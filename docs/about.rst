application out-of-the box. This is an online book written based on Odoo
**Community** and **Enterprise** Edition.

Why this book?
==============

After writing `Odoo 10 Implementation
Cookbook <https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/odoo-10-implementation-cookbook>`__,
I realized that it is too difficult to have the latest and up-to-date
printed book of each version for the fast evolving business application.
Odoo release its stable version every 12 to 15 months. The aim of this
book is to guide you through step-by-step configuration for business
problems.
