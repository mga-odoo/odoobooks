TDS stands for **Tax Deducted at Source**. It was introduced to collect tax at
the source from where an individual's income is generated.

The government uses TDS as a tool to collect tax in order to minimise tax e
vasion by taxing the income (partially or wholly) at the time it is generated
rather than at a later date.

TDS is applicable on the various incomes such as salaries, interest received,
commission received, consulting or professional services, job-work, etc.
